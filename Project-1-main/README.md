## Title
ETF Analysis

## Project Description
Our project is based upon ETFs in the Oil(OIH), U.S Energy(IYE), and Mining Sectors(XME). Our objective was to compare the ETFs past performances by analyzing their daily returns, cumulative returns, standard deviations, rolling standard deviations, exponential weighted average, sharpe ratios, and correlation. Additionally we forecasted the future performance of each ETF using a Monte Carlo simulation for 5 years of cumulative returns. We also calculated the expected portfolio returns at the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals based on initial investments of $10,000 and $17,000.

## Datasets Used
Historical stock data from all 3 ETFs pulling from an API

## Team Task Breakdown
Each team member was responsible for using alpaca to import their stock data into a dataframe and calculating the daily returns. we then combined them into a single dataframe and worked together to conduct the rest of the analysis.
